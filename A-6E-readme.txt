A-6E (YASim) readme.

This is not an authentic representation of an A-10 but it's based on
the right numbers, where I could find them.  There is a lot of
guesswork in the fdm.  It should also be noted that this a/c is still
very much under development, in nearly every respect and there are
several aspects which need fixing/improving.

uses a combination of aircraft geometry and performance data to
generate the flight model.
